# SpecStory's native redaction (v2.4.0+) and what it leaves us

SpecStory redacts secrets on write, so this skill's pre-commit layer is no
longer the first line of defense for `.specstory/history/`. This page records
what upstream covers, what it misses, and why our layer still exists.

## Upstream history

| Ref | What |
|---|---|
| [PR #235](https://github.com/specstoryai/getspecstory/pull/235) | `feat(redaction): automatically redact secrets from saved markdown history` — community PR by [@warnes](https://github.com/warnes), merged 2026-07-20 |
| [PR #253](https://github.com/specstoryai/getspecstory/pull/253) | A `gofmt` CI-fix fork of #235; closed in favor of #235 |
| **v2.4.0** (2026-07-20) | Shipped, **on by default**, covering local markdown **and** cloud sync |
| [#274](https://github.com/specstoryai/getspecstory/issues/274) (open) | Adjacent leak vector — `specstory watch` exposes the cloud auth token in its process command line |

The merged implementation is not the one in the PR. The maintainer swapped the
PR's 11 inline regexes for the [Betterleaks](https://github.com/betterleaks/betterleaks)
library ("we can leverage that community that is thinking about secrets
redaction as their sole focus") and unified the code paths that needed
redaction.

## Knobs

```bash
specstory sync  --no-redact-secrets     # also on `run` and `watch`
```

```toml
# .specstory/cli/config.toml (project) or ~/.specstory/cli/config.toml (user)
[redaction]
# Redact secrets and API keys from saved markdown history and cloud-synced
# session data. (default: true)
# enabled = false # equivalent to --no-redact-secrets
```

**`enabled` is the only knob.** The PR's `extra_patterns` (custom regexes) did
not survive the Betterleaks rewrite — there are no `extra_patterns` or
`GetRedactionExtraPatterns` symbols in the 2.9.0 binary. Repo-specific rules
have no upstream equivalent and stay our layer's job.

The placeholder is `[REDACTED:<betterleaks-rule-id>]` — the binary carries the
format string `[REDACTED:%s]`. Our redactor writes the same shape, and
`.gitleaks.toml` allowlists it, so whichever layer runs first the other sees an
inert placeholder and leaves the file alone.

## Coverage, measured

Probed against **specstory 2.9.0** / gitleaks 8.30.0. Each class is tested in
two contexts with two distinct tokens: `assign` (`KEY=<token>`) and `prose`
(the token in a sentence, the way a tool transcript prints one).

**SpecStory 36 · ours only 15 · uncovered by both 3** (of 54 class/context pairs)

### The structural finding: prose is the blind spot

Several classes are caught only in assignment context, and only by
betterleaks' entropy-based `generic-api-key` rule — which keys off a
`NAME = value` shape. The same token in prose sails through:

| Class | `assign` | `prose` |
|---|---|---|
| `openai-project-key` | SpecStory (`generic-api-key`) | **ours** |
| `huggingface-token` | SpecStory (`generic-api-key`) | **ours** |
| `notion-integration-token` | SpecStory (`generic-api-key`) | **ours** |
| `wakatime-api-key` | SpecStory (`generic-api-key`) | **ours** |
| `stripe-webhook-secret` | SpecStory (`generic-api-key`) | **ours** |

A transcript prints secrets in prose constantly — `cat .env` output, an error
message quoting a token, an agent echoing what it just read. Our
prefix-anchored rules do not care about surrounding syntax, so they hold in
both contexts.

### Covered by SpecStory in both contexts

`anthropic-api-key`, `openai-legacy-key`, `github-pat`,
`github-fine-grained-pat`, `github-oauth-token`, `github-actions-token`,
`gitlab-pat`, `google-api-key`, `groq-api-key`, `slack-bot-token`,
`stripe-secret-key`, `supabase-service-pat`, `linear-api-key`,
`private-key-pem`, `dotenv-dump`.

Notable: `private-key-pem` → `[REDACTED:private-key]`, exactly the label our
redactor now writes for PEM blocks.

### Ours in both contexts

`cursor-api-key`, `tailscale-auth-key`, `discord-webhook-url`,
`zapier-webhook-url`, `make-webhook-url` — the custom rules in
`assets/gitleaks.toml.template`. Betterleaks does not ship rules for these.

### Covered by nobody

| Class | Why |
|---|---|
| `aws-access-key-id` (both contexts) | gitleaks 8.30.0 has no dedicated `AKIA…` rule any more, and betterleaks doesn't either. In assignment form a *generic* rule may catch it; bare in prose nothing does. An access key ID is only half a credential (the secret access key is the sensitive half, and that one is high-entropy enough to be caught), so this is a defensible upstream choice rather than a hole to patch. |
| `telegram-bot-token` (prose only) | Caught in assignment form, missed in prose. Add a custom rule if you paste bot tokens into transcripts. |

### Negative controls

`sk-proj-XXX...`, `sk-ant-api03-XXX...`, `your-api-key-here`, `example-key`
and `OPENAI_API_KEY=REDACTED` all survive both layers. Transcripts can still
discuss key shapes in prose.

## What this means for our layer

1. **Keep it.** 15 of 54 class/context pairs are ours alone, including every
   webhook URL rule and every prose-context custom key.
2. **Stop duplicating.** Our redactor writes SpecStory's placeholder shape and
   allowlists it, so a transcript SpecStory already cleaned is not rewritten —
   no "files were modified by this hook", no re-`git add`, no second commit.
3. **`--legacy` changes bytes, not detection.** It writes the pre-2.4.0
   placeholders (`sk-abc...xyz`, `[REDACTED PEM PRIVKEY BLOCK]`) for repos
   whose transcripts are full of the old sentinels and that would rather not
   mix the two shapes. Detection, scope, and exit codes are identical, so
   there is no reason to reach for it on a SpecStory older than 2.4.0 — our
   layer scans the same way regardless of what SpecStory did or didn't do.
4. **Below 2.4.0 our layer is the only layer.** Nothing changes in how it
   runs; there is simply no Layer 0 in front of it, so expect it to actually
   rewrite files instead of finding everything already clean.

## Re-running the probe

`scripts/probe-specstory-redaction.py` synthesizes a Claude Code session under
`~/.claude/projects/<slug>/`, renders it twice through
`specstory sync claude --print` (with and without `--no-redact-secrets`), diffs
per class, then re-scans the redacted markdown with our gitleaks config to
compute the residual set. It cleans up after itself unless `--keep`.

The synthetic project path is resolved before deriving `<slug>`. On macOS,
`/var` resolves to `/private/var`; SpecStory looks up sessions from the physical
subprocess cwd, so using the unresolved temp path produces `1 session not
found`. See
[`pitfalls/specstory-sync-1-session-not-found-under-macos-var.md`](../../../../pitfalls/specstory-sync-1-session-not-found-under-macos-var.md).

Probe tokens are generated at runtime from a seeded PRNG, so this repo carries
key *shapes* but never a literal high-entropy token that would trip a scanner
on the probe's own source.

`tests/test_specstory_coverage.py` locks in the two facts we actually depend
on — that redaction is still on by default, and that the placeholder is still
`[REDACTED:<label>]` — and skips when `specstory` isn't installed.

## Cross-reference

- [`pre-commit-redaction-stack.md`](./pre-commit-redaction-stack.md) — where
  this sits in the layered defense.
- [`../assets/redact_secrets.py`](../assets/redact_secrets.py) — the redactor
  and its `--legacy` flag.
